# XORLISSJ
*XOR-pattern and Lissajous effect 2-in-1*
A 256-byte MS-DOS demo by ERN0 - 2016.09.20
Released at xxxxxxx Party, 2017

## This is not a 256-byte demo

[Tomcat/Abaddon](https://demozoo.org/sceners/8556/) was sitting next to me on some sceneparty, polishing his actual 256-byte demo entry. 
&dash; What do you think, will you win?
&dash; Meh, I lost my illusion, last time a XOR-pattern demo won.
&dash; What is XOR pattern?
&dash; When [the color of the pixel is `x XOR y`](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/xortexture.html).
&dash; I see, it's so easy that even I can do it!
&dash; Let's go!

I am not a math expert, so I have to find simple problems, if I want to make 256-byte demos. Years ago, when I was active 8086 coder, I've already made a similar stuff, [a 256-byte particle demo](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5305).

So, XORLISSJ is not the type of 256-byte demos which is full of amazing math and coding tricks, it's just a simple effect - actually, two effects -, which somehow fit in 256 byte. Consider it as educational or inspirational material.

## Compile and run

### Compile
I've used [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/):
`nasm xorlissj.asm -o xorlissj.com`

### Run

It's pure 80286 code, it can be run in [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/).
